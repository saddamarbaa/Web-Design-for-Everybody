                <summary>My childhood</summary>
                <p>
                    I am Sundaes refugee currently lives in Indonesia. Asurvivor of Genocide thatâ€™s still taking place in Darfur I lived a very difficult life in my childhood because I didn't have a school near my village, therefore, I had to wake up early morning every
                    day and go three hours by a donkey to another city for school to attend my classes and three hours to came back home. </p>
                It was very scary to go alone way in the early morning because I was the only child in the village who would go to school.
